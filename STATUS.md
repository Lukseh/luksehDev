## � **FIXED: Backend Stopping Issue**

### 🚨 **Issue**: Backend runs but stops after npm install
**Root Cause**: The "Launch Full Stack (Clean Build)" preLaunchTask was trying to start services AND the launch config was also starting them, causing conflicts.

### ✅ **Solution Applied**:
1. **Separated Tasks**: Created "Clean and Build (Pre-Launch)" that only cleans/builds without starting
2. **Fixed Launch Config**: Now uses correct pre-launch task that doesn't conflict
3. **Added Process Cleanup**: Stops running processes on ports before starting
4. **Sequential Timing**: Added delays to prevent startup conflicts

### 🎯 **Result**: Clean launch now works properly without stopping services

## �🚀 **How to Launch Full Stack**

### 🎯 **Quick Answer: YES and NO**

#### ✅ **`Start Full Stack`** (Quick Launch)
- **What it does**: Starts all services without cleaning
- **Time**: 30-60 seconds
- **Use when**: Daily development, quick testing

#### ✅ **`Clean Build and Start Full Stack`** (Complete Rebuild)
- **What it does**: 
  1. Cleans all build artifacts and caches
  2. Reinstalls dependencies
  3. Rebuilds .NET backend
  4. Starts all services fresh
- **Time**: 2-3 minutes
- **Use when**: After git pull, dependency changes, or build issues

### 🎛️ **Launch Options Available**

#### VS Code Tasks (Ctrl+Shift+P → Tasks: Run Task)
- **`Start Full Stack`** - Quick start (no clean)
- **`Clean Build and Start Full Stack`** - Full clean rebuild + start ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
